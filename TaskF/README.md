# ⚡ Task F -  Annual Electricity Consumption Reporting

## 🎯 Goal

The goal of this task is to build an **interactive report generator** in Python that:

* reads a full year of hourly measurement data from a CSV file
* uses **input-driven menus** so the user can choose different report types
* calculates summaries on daily, monthly, or yearly level
* prints the report in a clear format in the console
* optionally writes the report to a file (`report.txt`) based on the user’s choice

---

## 📄 Task Description

Create a Python program that:

1. **Reads data from the file `2025.csv`**
2. Provides the user with a **menu using input commands**, where the user can select different reports
3. **Calculates the selected report type**
   (e.g., date-range daily summary, monthly summary, full-year summary)
4. **Prints the report to the console** as clear text
5. After printing a report, asks the user:

   * `1) Write the report to the file report.txt`
   * `2) Create a new report`
   * `3) Exit`

   and behaves according to the choice
6. Writes the report to the file **`report.txt`** if the user chooses option 1

   * the filename is **always the same** (`report.txt`)
   * a new report **overwrites** the old one

The file `2025.csv` contains hourly measurements for the year 2025:

* timestamp (date and time)
* consumption (net) in kWh
* production (net) in kWh
* daily average temperature

The goal is to build an **interactive tool-like program** that feels more like a real utility than a one-off script.

---

## ⚖️ Units and Formatting Rules

Values in the file are already in **kWh**. In your report you must ensure:

* **Decimal values** are shown with **two decimal places**, using a **comma** as the decimal separator
* **Dates** are shown in format **dd.mm.yyyy** (e.g., `13.10.2025`)
* The report uses **clear headings and table-like formatting** so the content is easy to understand

---

## 1️⃣ Program Functionality

Your program must:

1. **Read the CSV file** `2025.csv`.
2. Convert rows into a structure that makes it easy to compute summaries on:

   * daily level
   * monthly level
   * yearly level
     (for example: lists, dictionaries, etc.)
3. Show the user a **main menu**:

```text
Choose a report type:
1) Daily summary for a date range
2) Monthly summary for one month
3) Full year 2025 summary
4) Exit the program
```

Menu format doesn't matter. As long as the numbers match the action above it will pass.

4. Ask for any required extra inputs based on the selection (see below).
5. Calculate and print the **report to the console**.
6. After printing, show a **second menu**:

```text
What would you like to do next?
1) Write the report to the file report.txt
2) Create a new report
3) Exit
```

* If the user selects **1**, write the **just-created report** to `report.txt`.
* If the user selects **2**, return to the main report menu.
* If the user selects **3**, exit the program.

The program runs in a **loop** until the user decides to stop. 🔁

## 📅 Report 1: Daily Summary for a Date Range

Ask the user:

* **Start date**: `Enter start date (dd.mm.yyyy):`
* **End date**: `Enter end date (dd.mm.yyyy):`

The report must include (Example below):

* the date range (dd.mm.yyyy–dd.mm.yyyy)
* total consumption for the range (kWh, two decimals, comma decimal separator)
* total production for the range (kWh, two decimals, comma decimal separator)
* average temperature for the range (for example: average of all hourly temperature values)

---

```
Enter start date (dd.mm.yyyy): 1.11.2025
Enter end date (dd.mm.yyyy): 30.11.2025
-----------------------------------------------------
Report for the period 1.11.2025–30.11.2025
- Total consumption: 1173,40 kWh
- Total production: 0,00 kWh
- Average temperature: 3,23 °C
```

---

## 📆 Report 2: Monthly Summary

Ask the user:

* **Month number** (1–12), for example: `Enter month number (1–12):`

The report must include (Example below):

* the month
* total consumption for the month (kWh)
* total production for the month (kWh)
* average daily temperature for the month

---

```
Enter month number (1–12): 6
-----------------------------------------------------
Report for the month: June
- Total consumption: 194,02 kWh
- Total production: 474,65 kWh
- Average temperature: 0,60 °C
```

---

## 📊 Report 3: Full Year 2025 Summary

The report must include (Example below):

* total consumption for 2025 (kWh)
* total production for 2025 (kWh)
* average temperature for the year

---

```
Report for the year: 2025
- Total consumption: 8741,12 kWh
- Total production: 2922,38 kWh
- Average temperature: 0,30 °C
```

---

## 2️⃣ Use of Functions (Mandatory)

The program must be built around **functions**, not written entirely at the top level.

You may use functions like these:

```python
def read_data(filename: str) -> list:
    """Reads a CSV file and returns the rows in a suitable structure."""
    ...

def show_main_menu() -> str:
    """Prints the main menu and returns the user selection as a string."""
    ...

def create_daily_report(data: list) -> list[str]:
    """Builds a daily report for a selected date range."""
    ...

def create_monthly_report(data: list) -> list[str]:
    """Builds a monthly summary report for a selected month."""
    ...

def create_yearly_report(data: list) -> list[str]:
    """Builds a full-year summary report."""
    ...

def print_report_to_console(lines: list[str]) -> None:
    """Prints report lines to the console."""
    ...

def write_report_to_file(lines: list[str]) -> None:
    """Writes report lines to the file report.txt."""
    ...
```

Also include a **main function**, for example:

```python
def main() -> None:
    """Main function: reads data, shows menus, and controls report generation."""
    ...
```

And at the end:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

---

### 📚 Docstring Requirement

Every function must include a **docstring** that clearly describes what the function does.

---

### 🧾 Type Hints (Required)

All functions must include **type hints**:

* parameter types
* return type

Example:

```python
from datetime import datetime, date
from typing import List

def convert_time(time_str: str) -> datetime:
    """Converts an ISO-formatted timestamp string into a datetime object."""
    ...
```

---

## 3️⃣ MIT Copyright Header

At the top of the Python file, include:

```python
# Copyright (c) 2025 Your Name
# License: MIT
```

---

## 4️⃣ Dates and Times – Use Data Types, Not Strings

**Important principle:**
When using conditionals (`if`) or comparisons with dates/times, **do not compare raw strings**.
Use correct data types (`datetime`, `date`).

❌ Bad example (string comparison):

```python
if time_str[:10] == "2025-10-13":
    ...
```

✅ Better example:

```python
from datetime import datetime, date

dt = datetime.fromisoformat(time_str)  # e.g. "2025-10-13T00:00:00"
day = dt.date()

if day == date(2025, 10, 13):
    ...
```

---

## 5️⃣ Finnish Formatting Emphasis 🇫🇮

In the report (`report.txt`) and in the console:

### 1. Date format

* Format: **dd.mm.yyyy**
* Example: `13.10.2025`

```python
date_str = f"{day.day}.{day.month}.{day.year}"
```

### 2. Decimal values (kWh)

* Use a **comma**, not a dot
* Round to **two decimals**

```python
value_kwh = 1.2345
value_str = f"{value_kwh:.2f}"          # "1.23"
value_str = value_str.replace(".", ",") # "1,23"
```

---

## 6️⃣ Basic Programming Structures (Mandatory)

Your program must include at least:

* **variables** (e.g., daily totals, monthly totals)
* **lists or other data structures** (e.g., list of measurements, list of report lines)
* **loops** (`for`, and if needed `while`) to iterate through rows, days, and months
* **conditionals** (`if`), especially for:

  * handling menu and input selections
  * selecting dates and months
* **functions** with:

  * docstrings
  * type hints

Additionally required:

* **file writing** using `with`, for example:

```python
with open("report.txt", "w", encoding="utf-8") as file:
    ...
```

* **inputs** that allow the user to control the program (menus, dates, months)
